### What is this repository for? ###

Worm Analysis for Live Detailed Observation, or WALDO, 
was designed with two primary functions in mind (1) to assess the quality
of your data aquisition setup and (2) to remove the disruptions in tracking
individual worms by correcting many types of imaging errors that occur during
real time processing.

### How do I get set up? ###
A pdf Quick Start Guide and User Manual can be found [here](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/resources/software/waldo).

A compiled version of the WALDO code is available for download [here](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/resources/software/waldo). 

To check out the source code repository make sure to install [mercurial](\path{https://mercurial.selenic.com/}) and then use the command:
