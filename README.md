### What is this repository for? ###

Worm Analysis for Live Detailed Observation, or WALDO, 
was designed with two primary functions in mind (1) to assess the quality
of your data aquisition setup and (2) to remove the disruptions in tracking
individual worms by correcting many types of imaging errors that occur during
real time processing.

### How do I get set up? ###

A compiled version of the WALDO code is available for download [here](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/resources/software/waldo)
is to download the zipped folder .
After you unzip the folder, you can run waldo by double clicking on the guiwaldo.exe application.
If you plan on running WALDO more frequently, we heavily recommend you create a shortcut for guiwaldo and placing it on your desktop.

\path{https://bitbucket.org/peterbwinter/waldo}).
After installing mercurial 
(\path{https://mercurial.selenic.com/}), the WALDO source code can be installed using the command:
`\path{hg clone https://peterbwinter@bitbucket.org/peterbwinter/waldo waldo}'
Once the repository is cloned, you can launch WALDO's graphical user interface with the command:
`python waldo/code/guiwaldo.py'
